# Titanic Survival Prediction Model

## Background
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous incidents in history. This analysis aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the survival of Titanic passengers.

## Contents of the Notebook

1. **Import Library**: Necessary libraries for the analysis are imported.
2. **Import Dataset**: The Titanic dataset is imported for analysis.
3. **Data Cleaning**: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to ensure its readiness for modeling.
4. **Create Dummy Variables**: Categorical features in the dataset are converted into dummy/indicator variables.
5. **Train Test Split**: The cleaned dataset is split into training and test sets to evaluate the performance of the model.
6. **Model Building & Evaluation**: Different machine learning models are trained and tested to identify the best model for predicting survival.
7. **Conclusion**: The Decision Tree Classifier is identified as the best model with an accuracy of 0.86.

## Conclusion
Based on the analysis in this notebook, the Decision Tree Classifier is the most suitable model for predicting the survival of Titanic passengers with an accuracy of 0.86.
